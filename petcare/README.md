# Pet Care App

My goal was to create a mobile application to aid pet owners in caring for their pets. I designed over 30 screens to cover all necessary business procedures, using FlutterFlow for both design and implementation to produce streamlined and concise Flutter code.

This was a challenging task that involved developing various custom widgets and Flutter code backed up with Firebase as a backend.

The resulting cross-platform application functioned flawlessly on iOS, Android, and the Web. Unfortunately I can't provide production link cause this startup is closed already.
