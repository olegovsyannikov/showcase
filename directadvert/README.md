# Directadvert Landing

The purpose of this landing website is to attract advertisers and publishers to join the ad network. As the project leader, I designed and coded the front-end using React and Next.js.

The main challenge was to create a landing page that is both attractive to the target audience and highly converting. We went through multiple iterations until the metrics reached an acceptable level.
